This project has the source code for a discord bot application that rolls die and shows the results. All commands are prefixed with '>'. It is still in development.

You can get help by typing >aaaaaaaa (the amount of a letters you put in doesn't matter).

If you want to self host the bot, you need to create a bot application at [Discord for developers](https://discord.com/developers/) and insert the bot token in the client.run() function. Be aware this token is the password for your bot and you should never share it.

Documentation for the API used in the project can be found at [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
